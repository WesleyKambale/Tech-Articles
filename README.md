# Tech Articles by Wesley Kambale
Welcome to my series of Technical Articles written via [Wesley Kambale](https://kambale.hashnode.dev) on Hashnode.
These articles steam from a wide range of topics in the tech world, and from the word 'Go', they are curated for Ugandan students and young developers to easily make their their way through their careers.

Some of these articles might be part of the mainstream lot you find in Google searches but having trailed them for long to kickdstart my career as a Software developer, I can convincing tell you that it's a hustle, and muddy to find your way through because the content is not curated to fit the Ugandan tech space.

There's a balance to also enable international readers to follow through. So, don't be afraid.
